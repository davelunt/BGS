BEWARE of screwed up single quotes


`sed "s/$/-heart/" list3.txt > heartlist.txt`
Created two lists of gene names
They have some different frequencies of a few genes
Appended -lung or -heart to all gene names
`sed "s/$/-heart/" heart_gene_list.txt > heartlist.txt`
`sed “s/$/-lung/" lung_gene_list.txt > lunglist.txt`

Concatenate these
`cat *list.txt > allgenes.txt`
Too many files named the same! Instead
`cat heartlist.txt > allgenelist.txt`
`cat lunglist.txt >> allgenelist.txt`
Seems to have worked

Randomise allgenelist.txt
`shuf allgenelist.txt -o generandomorder.txt`
Test it
`shuf list3.txt -o list3randomorder.txt`
Worked and I created generandomorder.txt which looks OK

genelist.txt is the new random list and testlist.txt is the test with small numbers

`grep -e '-lung' testlist.txt > lungtest.txt`
Worked, though not sure why I need the -e option to find a pattern

`grep -e ‘-lung’ genelist.txt > lunglist.txt`

-----------------------------
NOW INTO ATOM...

grep -e '-lung' genelist.txt > lunglist.txt
grep -e '-heart' genelist.txt > heartlist.txt

we can get a count of unique names by using uniq -c
but we have to sort first

sort heartlist.txt | uniq -c > heartgenes_uniqsorted.txt
OK but why the left whitespace?

sort heartlist.txt | uniq -c | sort -rn > heartlistcount.txt
sort lunglist.txt | uniq -c | sort -rn > lunglistcount.txt

head -5 lunglistcount.txt
head -5 heartlistcount.txt

works!
