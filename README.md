# BGS Bacterial Genome Sequencing

This repo contains information for running the undergraduate Bacterial Genome Sequencing module at the University of Hull, UK

The bioinformatics exercises require the use of a jupyter notebooks with a unix/bash kernel, and software installed (ideally as a conda environment) as described in the `env.yaml` environment file.

the `/data` dierectory contains data for all exercises but the full E. coli genome sequence data is too large for this git repository.
