# Genome Assembly Bioininformatics

You will be given a verbal introduction and support as you go through all the work.

We will start with the notebook `intro_to_unix_command_line.ipnb`. Open and read, trying the examples for yourself as you go through. This will teach you key skills you will need in the rest of this course.

Next we will use your new skills to examine the sequence data that you generated last term. You will describe to the sequence data, and quality control it retaining only the highest quality reads for further analysis.

You will then Assemble your bacterial genomes, and analyse the genomes you have assembled. You will describe how many contigs are produced, how many reads were assebled, and several other key assembly statistics you will learn. This will be an important part of you Results section of your final submission.

At the end you will be able to say that you have "good basic data analysis and bioinformatics skills" on your cv, and be able to list an impressive set of specific bioinformatics analyses that you have done.
